subtitle: on translating Mariama Ndiaye
note: "<p>Of the few poems I’ve translated in my life, this was definitely the most
  challenging. Ndiaye utilizes a lot of great imagery throughout the poem related
  to being the nurse or caretaker of someone that was difficult to translate directly.
  For example, <em>de couver</em> in the line “de couver mon sommeil éternel” translates
  most directly to “to wrap a child in cotton wool.” I tried to preserve this notion
  through the use of the word “swathe,” which similarly refers to the idea of wrapping
  a baby in fabric. I also struggled with the line “to care not to hide.” This translation
  originally did not make much sense to me within the context of the poem, so I tried
  many different versions and arrangements. However, I continued to come back to this
  most direct translation of Ndiaye’s words. I feel like it allows the most room for
  interpretation of her meaning without my own personal inputs. I maintain her punctuation,
  line breaks, and structure throughout the entire poem, along with the repetition
  of “When I Die.”</p>"
abio: "<p>Mariam Ndiaye is a Senegalese poet and politician. Unfortunately, this was
  the extent of the information I was able to find about her through the Internet.
  These poems were sourced from an anthology of Senegalese poetry published by the
  Senegalese Center of P.E.N. International.</p>"
