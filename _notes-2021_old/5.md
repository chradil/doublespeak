      This poem was recommended to me by an Arabic-speaking friend (who also
      proofread my translation, bless her). I loved the beautiful and—is it silly
      to say?—poetic metaphors that Qabbani employs throughout the poem. These
      images translated very well into English. Descriptions such as “like hay
      under the rain” need no explanation or elaboration to connote the sense of
      slowly soaking into uselessness and rotting away; the metaphor itself does
      all of that already. Though no contextualization was needed, the tricky
      part was simply choosing the right words to illustrate those metaphors and
      to maintain the same implications.

      I found myself struggling with the tone of the speaker. Because the poem is
      mostly in the imperative, he comes across as a bit harsh and exasperated
      with his beloved and her waffling. However, he at times also softens his
      words, as in the end of the second verse and beginning of the third, in
      which he recognizes how difficult his request is for her and how much he is
      asking of her. Striking a balance between his exasperation and his
      understanding of her was difficult.

      I did take a bit of license with the specific grammatical structures of a
      few lines for clarity, as well as with alliteration, which was not quite as
      present in the original text but was in keeping with its original lyrical
      fluidity. Lines like “trial, torment, and tears” could have perhaps been
      more directly translated as “harshness, torment, and tears,” but I found
      “trial” to suit the sense of the line, as well as its sound, better. The
      original text I used also did not have stanza breaks. I inserted these
      based on common divisions I found in other versions and translations of the
      poem, as well as on where they seemed most fitting content-wise.

      <strong>Nizar Qabbani</strong> was a Syrian poet, writer, diplomat, and intellectual, though
      he is most widely known for his poetry. Qabbani was born in Damascus in
      1923. He is considered one of the most prominent Arab poets, and often
      wrote on social and political themes, such as feminism and Arab
      nationalism; he also wrote many erotic and love poems, such as this one.
      Qabbani’s work was often controversial both for its social and sexual
      progressivism, but he remained a beloved public figure internationally. He
      also worked in the Syrian diplomatic service for many years, writing all
      the while. Qabbani married twice, first to Zahra Aqbiq and later to Balqis
      al-Rawi, an Iraqi diplomat, whose death in a 1981 bombing in Beirut deeply
      affected him. He wrote extensively about his love for al-Rawi both before
      and after her death. Qabbani himself died in London in 1998 and was buried
      in Damascus. He is considered to be Syria’s national poet.
