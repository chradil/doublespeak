pid: '36'
translator: Darío Goldgel Carballo
subtitle: on translating Federico García Lorca
note: "<p>I read several English translations of this famous poem and always encountered
  the same problem: the words of the poet are treated as a sacred material, and the
  translator’s objective is to find the closest intelligible approximation. Yet here
  Lorca combines both literary exquisiteness with a sort of childish nonsense (as
  is the arbitrary repetition of some words), which conveys what I believe to be the
  poem’s universality. Moreover, the octosyllabic verse is the traditional form of
  the popular song in Spanish, and breaking it results in a text intended to be read
  and not to be listened to. Perhaps out of stubbornness, I decided to keep the octosyllable.
  However, as I felt this structure sounded too foreign in English, I rearranged it
  into iambic tetrameter. Now, those familiar with Spanish may know it is quite verbose
  as a language, so filling up some of those verses was a challenge. Sometimes I even
  had the opposite problem as seen in the example of the word <em>olivar</em> (“field
  of olive trees”). After accepting the limitations of the translation process, my
  solution was either to heretically add my own words or to mutilate the text, so
  I could preserve the musicality (<em>perdón, Federico</em>).</p>"

  <p>Federico García Lorca (1898–1936) is perhaps the most renowned Spanish poet and playwright of the twentieth century and one of the main figures of the avant-garde in Spain. This poem, from his 1928 book <em>Romancero Gitano</em> (lit. <em>Gypsy Songbook</em>), combines the influence of classical poets from sixteenth-century Spain with the surrealist movement of its epoch. It also references the popular song from the subaltern classes of southern Spain and features a strong influence from its Arabic roots. As such, many of his poems (this one included) have been adapted as flamenco songs during the years.</p>
  <p>A supporter of socialism, García Lorca was arrested and assassinated by fascists at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War.</p>
tbio: "<p>Darío Goldgel Carballo is a PhD candidate in the romance languages department
  at the University of Pennsylvania, where he analyzes movies no one will watch and
  books no one will read in order to reflect on the social realities of Latin America.
  Darío really hates writing his own biography, as he feels it sounds like boasting,
  and will hope that <em>DoubleSpeak</em> is informal enough to forgive him. He has,
  indeed, done some stuff in his life, but nothing that can trick the readers into
  taking his translation more seriously.</p>"
