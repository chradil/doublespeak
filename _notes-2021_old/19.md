subtitle: on translating Sigbjørn Obstfelder
note: "<p>“The City” is a prose poem by Sigbjørn Obstfelder, the father of Norwegian
  modernist poetry. This poem is an exceptionally good example of his work because
  it depicts the anxiety of Norway’s transition from a rural, pastoral society to
  an industrialized, modern nation. We see a country-dwelling Norwegian decide to
  make his way into town for a wholesome reason, only to experience an anxiety attack
  similar to that portrayed in Munch’s <em>Scream</em>.</p>\n \n<p>The work of Obstfelder
  is challenging to translate today because of the interlingual nature of late nineteenth-century
  Norway. Still a young nation at the time, Norway was heavily Danish but was emerging
  as modern Bokmål. Beyond that, stylistically, Obstfelder has a jerky, hyphenated
  style that says much with few words. The former reveals his nervous nature and the
  latter puts him firmly in the Norwegian tradition.</p>\n"

  <p>Sigbjørn Obstfelder (21 November 1866–29 July 1900) was a nineteenth-century Norwegian writer, a close friend of Edvard Munch, an inspiration to Rainier Maria Rilke, and the father of modernist Norwegian poetry. His poem “Jeg Ser” is known by all Norwegians and mimics the sense of alienation depicted in Munch’s famous painting <em>The Scream.</em></p>

  <p>In 1890, Obstfelder moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, but after only a year, he had a nervous breakdown and returned to Norway. After several years of moving around with the Norwegian intellectual scene, he died of tuberculosis at the age of thirty-three on the same day as the birth of his only child Lili.</p>
