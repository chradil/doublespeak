translator: 'Maria Dahvana Headley '
subtitle: on translating Qasmūna bint Ismāʿil
note: "<p>These two poems were written by the eleventh-century Iberian Jewish poet
  Qasmūna bint Ismāʿil. Very little is known about her, and only a few poems survive,
  written in Arabic. For these translations, which were included in my 2017 story
  “The Orange Tree” about a female wooden golem and the poet who commissions her to
  be built, I did literal translations and then played with them. The story was in
  the <em>Best American Fantasy and Science Fiction</em> volume edited by N.K. Jemisin.</p>"
