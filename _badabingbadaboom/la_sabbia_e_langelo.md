  "I.
  Non occorrevano i templi in rovina sul limitare dei deserti,
  Con le colonne mozze e le gradinate che in nessun luogo conducono;
  Né i relitti insabbiati, le ossa biancheggianti lungo il mare;
  E nemmeno la violenza del fuoco contro i nostri campi e le case.
  Bastava che l'ombra sorgesse dall'angolo più quieto della stanza,
  O vegliasse dietro la nostra porta socchiusa —
  La fine pioggia ai vetri, un pezzo di latta che gemesse nel vento:
  Noi sapevamo già di appartenere alla morte.
  "
transpoem: "I.\nWe did not need the temples in ruin at the edge of deserts,\nWith
  broken columns and stairs that led nowhere;\nNor the sand-buried shipwrecks, the
  bleached bones along the sea;\nNot even the violence of the fire against our fields
  and homes.\nIt was enough that the shadow rose from the quietest corner of the room,\nOr
  kept vigil behind our half-closed door —\nThe thin rain on the windows, a sheet
  of tin that groaned in the wind:\nWe already knew we belonged to death.\n\nII.\nIf
  you want to leave your trace, man, score the sand instead,\nBecause the highest
  earth will become sand in the end.\nYou write your name on the deserted waterfront,
  and pray the sea soon covers it in tears:\nBecause you yourself are sand, you are
  the death that remains after you.\n\nIII.\nEvery time we said goodbye;\nEvery time
  that we turned toward childhood, loss at our backs,\n(The soul shaking in its long
  lament);\nEvery time that we separated ourselves from a lover in the cold twilight
  of the sunrise;\nEvery time that we saw the enigma close again in dead eyes;\nOr
  even when we simply listened to the wind in the deserted streets,\nAnd watched autumn
  pass on the hill,\nThe Angel was at our side and it consumed us.\n\nIV.\nNow our
  love will scatter upon the vineyard and the field,\nOur venom in the cacti and the
  cruel thorns.\nThe living will crouch by the springs, they will say:\n'Who pushes
  toward us the water from hidden veins of the world?'\nAnd long before the cold gathers
  them and the night lays down upon their heart,\nEven in a midday of bees and sweet
  nectars,\nThey will know anguish because we are powerful and near,\nAnd there is
  no escape from the circle in which we already hold them,\nWith every stalk raised
  from us, and every full and heavy fruit that bows toward our earth.\n\nV.\nThey
  were the last voices to fall quiet. Not the unbearable voices\nOf wars and hurricanes,
  \nNor the human and loved voices,\nBut murmurs of grasses and waters, laughter of
  wind, rustle\nOf ferns between which invisible squirrels played,\nHum of insects
  across many summers\nDown to that insect which incessantly buzzed\nIn the room where
  we did not want to die.\nAnd everything collided in a note, in a rest\nAnd whispered
  tumult, like that of blood,\nWhen our blood was living. But we already knew\nThat
  it was impossible to respond to everything.\nAnd when the Angel asked us: 'Do you
  want to remember again?'\nWe ourselves implored him: 'Leave, that silence comes!'\n\nVI.\nNeither
  the broken branch, nor the trampled grass alongside the paths\nTold us of its passage,
  but the touch of solitude\nThat each thing keeps in itself and returns to us, freeing\nAfter
  the usual message, the other, unknown word.\nHow we startled listening to it, how
  securely it set\nOur heart on the invisible track!\nSo we always followed you, Ruler
  and Lover,\nNor did the white light in which you walk unveiled at our side surprise
  us,\n(Now that the carnal shadow has set on the horizon of death),\nSince for many
  years you alone we knew, you alone\nWe obeyed, your destined prey,\nDragging on
  the streets of the earth your strange celestial chain.\n"
