subtitle: on translating Pablo Neruda
note: "<p>“Verb” by Pablo Neruda explores language at its very core – as a medium
  for conveying the human experience. Yet Neruda, in his poem, latches onto that liminal
  space of the inexpressible, yearning for words that could begin to capture the pain
  of the Latin American people. With this in mind, I knew that translating this poem
  would require diligent attention to diction. And like Neruda, I wanted to use words
  that were intense, synesthetic, and multiplicitous. Below is a brief description
  of the thought process behind some of these selections.</p>\n\n<li><em>Arrugar</em>
  means “to wrinkle,” “to crumple,” or “to shrivel.” I opted for “shrivel” not only
  because of its stronger connotation but because becoming shriveled necessitates
  a loss of water. This provides an interesting contrast to the water motif (river,
  thirst, etc.)</li>\n<li><em>Torcer</em> means “to twist, “to bend,” or “to sprain.”
  I landed on “sprain” because it evokes a sense of physicality and pain which is
  reflected in the rest of the poem. </li>\n<li><em>Lisa</em> means “smooth,” “flat,”
  or “plain.” I chose “plain” not only because it conveys the blandness of the word
  but also because it references a geographical feature which is flat in itself. This
  additionally connects with the river erosion imagery at the end of the stanza.</li>
  \ \n<li><em>Aspereza</em> means “roughness,” “sourness,” or “sharpness.” Since roughness
  is associated with the sense of touch and sourness with the sense of taste, I selected
  “sharpness” because it evokes both senses.</li>\n<li><em>Adentro</em> means “inside,”
  but I opted for “lodged,” which has a more intrinsic connotation. At the same time,”
  lodged” can also mean “to be flattened by wind or rain,” which ties into the first
  stanza.</li>\n<li><em>Sonido</em> means “sound” or “noise,” and I chose “noise,”
  which is the more intense adjective. </li>"
abio: "<p>Pablo Neruda (1904–1973) is one of the best-known Latin American poets of
  the twentieth century. Hailing from Chile, he received the Nobel Prize for Literature
  in 1971 “for a poetry that with the action of an elemental force brings alive a
  continent’s destiny and dreams.” In fact, many of his poems were imbued with a sense
  of politics, which was contextualized by Neruda’s ardent support of the Communist
  Party and his role as a diplomat. His famous works include <em>Veinte poemas de
  amor y una canción desesperada</em> (<em>Twenty Love Poems and A Desperate Song</em>)
  and <em>Crepusculario</em> (<em>Book of Twilight</em>).</p>"
tbio: "<p>Heta Patel is a senior at the University of Pennsylvania studying health
  and societies and Hispanic studies. Language, for her, is an extension of her interest
  in understanding people, the way they think, and the way their bodies interact with
  the world. Although this interest has largely manifested itself in her pursuing
  medicine and immersing herself in Spanish, she has also found writing and translating
  poetry instrumental in her desire to learn more about the human condition. In her
  free time, she enjoys curating her Spotify playlists and bullet journaling.</p>\n"
