subtitle: on translating Yaroslav (Slava) Mogutin
note: |-
  <p>I began with a literal translation of the poem, ignoring word order and providing several translations of the same words to choose from later. Next, I formatted lines to match the original poem. Before moving onto polishing, I also identified turns of phrase that would need more time and thought to accurately incorporate into a final product. In polishing my rough translation of Mogutin’s poem, I began by adjusting word order to best match the point of syllabic emphasis in each clause, while with Mayakovsky’s I focused more on the emotions behind the poem. I then moved to honing in on word choices, leaving notes that indicated desired sentiment where I was still unsure of what I wanted to highlight. Next, I read through, thoughtfully evaluating and altering verb choices based on verbal aspect and active-passive voice within the clause. Lastly, I reviewed capitalization, punctuation, and line breaks to best match the original. A series of more detailed notes regarding stylistic choices in my translation are listed below:</p>
  <p><strong>“Conversation of a drunk poetess and her new lover:</strong></p>
  <p><em>захожу в дома</em> — To maintain the poetess’ conversational tone, I translated the prefix за- as indicative of fleeting entrances, in which “I swing by” felt more appropriate.</p>
  <p><em>благодать такая</em> —  Такая</em> indicates a conversational ellipsis and buffer around the verb. I added “sort of” to add a brief pause to the line and slightly dampen the verb’s delivery.</p>
  <p><em>от меня лучи во все стороны</em> — “Beams” highlighted the emanating light of a saintly glow. I added “of light” to ensure readers wouldn’t picture large beams of wood protruding from the poetess. I inserted “going” into my translation of во все стороны</em> to highlight the outward movement indicated by the accusative case while maintaining a similar meter.</p>
  <p><em>между прочим, тебе телефон из-за меня отключили</em> — I originally translated this section as “it was cause of me that your phone line / was cut off.” I moved “cause of me” to the second line to improve the flow of the first. I also shortened “because" to “cause,” to soften the point of emphasis on “me” in the sentence.</p>
  <p><em>телефон твой пиздец совсем, е.т.м.!</em> — I was struck by the sudden heatedness of this line and hoped to highlight it. I considered “your phone is totally fucked up,” but didn’t want the line sounding redundant when paired with the е.т.м.!</em> (“fuck your mother”). Given the wide range of meanings for пиздец</em>, “your phone is a total piece of shit, you motherfucker” fit the build and tone of the line best.</p>

      Slava Mogutin, born in Kemerovo, Siberia in 1974, is a New York-based
      artist, writer, and social activist. Slava’s career began with writing for
      independent newspapers and media outlets in Moscow. Son of Soviet poet and
      novelist, Yuri Mogutin, Slava’s background in writing proved useful as he
      forged his career in journalism. His 1994 staged registry for a same-sex
      marraige liscence with his partner, Robert Filipinni, drew media attention
      as the first of its kind in the Russian Federation, but was rejected
      following a failed referendum of a 1969 Soviet law defining marriage as “a
      voluntary union between a man and woman.” Ensuing police harassment and
      another charge for “inflaming national, social, and religious division”
      motivated his subsequent immigration to New York.

      Mogutin’s writing centers themes of queerness and masculinity, and is
      heavily influenced by his experiences as an immigrant and dissident. His
      poems confront societal norms unabashedly. In New York, Slava continues to
      publish his work. His publications include titles in Russian, translations
      of Allen Ginsberg, monographs, essays, poems, and prose. Mogutin is the winner
      of the Andrey Bely Prize, and his writing and photography have been featured
      in publications worldwide, including the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>Stern</em>, <em>Flash Art</em>,
      <em>Libération</em>, and the <em>Calvert Journal</em>.
