subtitle: on translating Amina Saïd
note: |-
  <p>
      I have loved the poems of Amina Saïd since I discovered her during my first
      year of college three years ago. Her rawness and directness comfort me; she
      employs common language and a lack of punctuation, which enable the reader
      to grapple directly with each word on the page. This poem is one of my
      absolute favorites, for it is easy to fall in love with the first line; the
      evocative imagery jumps out at the reader, forcing her to come to terms
      with a violent, self-destructive sun and its rebirth after tragedy each
      day. This concept forces us to consider the essence of life, of our own
      regeneration with the coming and going of each day. I chose to translate
      "égorge son spectre" as "slits the throat of its former self" instead of
      "slits the throat of its ghost" in order to convey a sense of rebirth and
      regeneration of the sun as its own entity or "former self." I wanted to
      delineate the poem's first line, which also serves as its title, as
      evocative of the essence of a phoenix being reborn from ashes, and
      therefore believe the indication of "former self" is necessary in order to
      distinguish between a sense of the past and of the present.

      With the line "each beginning represents a circle," I chose to translate
      the French <em>dessine</em> ("to draw") in a more symbolic manner in order
      to underscore the symbolism of a circle as representative of a beginning or
      of this feeling of rebirth that the first line of the poem conveys. In this
      manner, I chose the word "possibilities" in lieu of "beginnings" for the
      French <em>commencements</em> in the following line to emphasize the sense
      of possibility that is enabled through rebirth, which inherently
      constitutes a new beginning.

      Saïd shirks off any usage of punctuation or capitalization; it seems that
      in some portions of the poem, particularly 'and what was begins again,'
      might be better clarified by punctuation. However, I find the beauty in
      Saïd's poetry to underscore an ephemerality rooted within words and a
      constancy lodged within uncertainty. Saïd seems to be telling us that
      poetry and therefore life cannot be fully understood through generic
      formulas of punctuation, but rather through endeavoring to unravel the
      deeper meaning within a collection of words themselves.

      I felt calm when reading the second to last stanza, for I find solace in
      the repetition of the French word <em>de</em> ('of') for this repetition
      suggests the struggle of remembrance, of attempting to uncover past
      memories which are so inextricably tied to the present and the future that
      the lines of distinction are blurred. This repetition also mimics Saïd's
      signature rambling style, forcing the reader to consider the poem as a
      stream of consciousness that can apply to any person's experience of life
      and of the trials and tribulations involved with love, darkness, and light.

      Saïd juxtaposes notions of 'you' with 'me' in order to more fully arrive at
      the idea of an intertwining of souls, yet I believe that the beauty of this
      poem is more so discovered by ascertaining the connection of the individual
      self (or selves) with nature. By noting that 'we fall in love with the
      night' and 'we fall in love with the day,' she avails us to the beauty of
      life and the evocations of lightness and darkness imbued within it.

abio: "<p>Born in Tunis in 1953, Amina Saïd was raised bilingual, learning both Arabic
  and French in school and speaking Arabic, the language of her parents, at home.
  After being encouraged by her teacher, she began to write poetry in middle school
  and soon became enamored with the power of the written word to relate essential
  truths of being. She studied English in college and started to publish poetry soon
  after graduation. Saïd made a living as a journalist in France but continued to
  write throughout her life, ultimately publishing her work in numerous poetry collections
  and being considered as a unique voice based on her Tunisian heritage and experimentation
  with form.</p>"
