      These four poems are from <em>Cuando todo refugio se vuelva hostil</em> (<em>When Every
  Refuge Turns Hostile</em>), which Tamara published in 2019, and I first heard
      her read in 2020 during a virtual event featuring pandemic poetry. Just the
      way she had numbered her days, way before all of us began counting each
      pandemic day, proved to be an example of her signature style. Examining
      herself and her social milieu, her verses trace the coming of age and
      awareness of a young and avid reader and writer for whom words are not just
      the currency of everyday life, but a practical science. Making observations
      of tangible moments or psychological ones, Grosso questions emotions,
      prejudices, old habits — her own and others’. In clever quips,
      anxiety-inducing moments are brought under control by the power of words.

      In a sense, translating these poems into English was quite straightforward
      when it came to word choice, for meaning, but striking the same tone as the
      original is the challenge, the goal. For example, in “Day 15,” “poemas de
      desamor” becomes “unlove poems;” it seems to be an easy and transparent
      choice and I’m not unhappy with it at all, but I can’t shake the sense that
      the word <em>desamor</em> will always sound more dramatic than the word “unlove,”
      and I can’t change that. More of a puzzle, in the same poem, was the verb
      <em>ilusionarse</em>, for which the translation becomes a compound of verbs, and
      offers the chance to try various combinations until the one sounding most
      lyrical is found.

      In another poem, “Day 20,” the use of a funny expression might have posed a
      puzzle, but since it’s actually not a widely used colloquialism
      necessitating a determined English equivalent, a literal translation worked
      well to elicit the same quizzical response it provokes in the original.
      Suffice it to say, the choice phrase in question, the “mayonnaise jar” from
      which Grosso decides not to remove herself, serves as the phrase with which
      she declares where she is writing <em>from</em>. It’s an imaginative metaphor, a
      form she often employs, along with her wry humor, to surpass or solve the
      question posed by the poem. In her well-meditated but short answers, her
      poetry empowers both writer and reader. Her succinct texts, born into a
      world of strong social media use, are <strong>meant</strong> to be shared widely. The fact
      that Grosso is adamant that anyone should be able to find her poems —
      “anyone, for instance me at age thirteen, at fifteen, when I didn’t know
      which books to buy, when I lived in Ciudadela, when I didn’t read poetry” —
      has garnered her thousands of enthusiastic Spanish-language readers and
      followers. It’s the translator’s intention that this generation of English
      language readers have the chance to engage as well.
