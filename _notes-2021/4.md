subtitle: on translating Christina Perri Rossi

  <p>
      The poem 'Come'/ 'Ven' is from one of Cristina Peri Rossi's most recent
      volumes of poetry, <em>Las Replicantes </em>(<em>The Replicants</em>,
      Ediciones Cálamo, 2016). Peri Rossi's poetic work over the past fifty years
      creates an archive of lesbian affection and queer kinship, centering
      desire, eroticism, and intimacy. My translations of her work are informed
      by an attention to that intimacy, and 'Come'/ 'Ven' is no exception. One
      such approach to this work was including select fragments of the Spanish
      within the English version in order to signal intimate speech acts. There
      are certain terms of endearment that transcend recontextualization in
      English, but there are also those that signal a familiarity and exclusivity
      that I choose to illuminate by setting them apart linguistically. By
      highlighting the lovers' dialogue in Spanish ('te esnifas el tiempo,'
      literally 'you are sniffing time,' meaning 'you are wasting time,' and 'un
      día es largo como un siglo,' literally 'a day is long as a century'), I
      remind the reader that these speech acts are exclusive, separate, yearning,
      undressed.

      Cristina Peri Rossi
      is a Uruguayan novelist, poet, and translator. Born in Montevideo, she has
      lived in Barcelona since the 1970s, when she went into political exile.
      Considered the only woman associated with the Latin American Boom, Peri
      Rossi has never ceased to publish work, despite political repression,
      tenuous immigration status, and linguistic discrimination. She has
      published nineteen books of poetry, earning her many literary prizes,
      including the Rafael Alberti International Poetry Prize, the City of
      Torrevieja International Poetry Prize, the Loewe Foundation International
      Poetry Prize, and a Guggenheim Fellowship.
