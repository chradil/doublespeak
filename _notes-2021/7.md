  <p><em>плевочки</em> — A plural, diminutive form of плевок</em>, meaning “spit.” Originally, I translated the word as “spittles,” but felt that it was out of place. While somewhat contrived, “spitlets” offered a more robust alternative that could more easily be imagined in individual units.</p>
  <p><em>жемчужиной</em> — In my rough translation, I translated this word as “pearl-like,” but found that it slowed the meter’s momentum. The shift to “pearls” as a subject complement to the direct object, improved fluidity while adding a luster to the otherwise gross imagery of bits of spit. I felt that this was closer to Mayakovsky’s poetic intentions for the phrase.</p>

      Vladimir Mayakovsky—poet, playwright, satirist, revolutionary, and
      futurist—was born in present-day Georgia to a Cossack father of noble
      descent and a Ukrainian mother. Moving to Moscow as a teenager, Mayakovsky
      was radicalized and joined local socialist groups. Following a brief prison
      sentence, Vladimir distanced himself from the Party, focusing instead on
      his independent socialist education. Mayakovsky discovered his literary
      voice as he became more involved in the Moscow artists’ circles of the
      1910s. He made his name in Futurist literary magazines with early poems
      like “Night” and “Take That!” Mayakovsky played a key role in early
      Bolshevik literature following the October Revolution, supporting socialist
      ideology not only in his writing but also through plays, film, and
      agitational propaganda. Mayakovsky’s <em>Vladimir Ilyich Lenin</em>, a poetic epic
      in tribute to the vanguard of the revolution, was applauded by both the
      Party and Soviet citizens. After the release of two satire pieces in the
      late 1920s, Vladimir’s relationship with the Party began to deteriorate and
      Soviet media targeted him in media campaigns. Following an argument with a
      romantic partner in 1930, Mayakovsky died of suicide. Mayakovsky’s
      pioneered Futurist and Socialist Realist genres, gaining revered status in
      the Soviet canon.
