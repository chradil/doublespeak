translator: Karina Carreras
subtitle: on translating Pavel Friedmann
note: "<p>I translated this poem in a very minimalistic way because I wanted to emphasize
  the sadness and emptiness of the poem. The meaning of this poem is Pavel trying
  to find hope where he is. He finds hope when he sees this beautiful yellow butterfly
  but he sees it drift away, and he never sees it again. I wanted to preserve the
  spacing and alignments of the original because I feel like it was very important
  in the original, the emphasis of him not seeing a butterfly and then the indents
  on “the ghetto” added to the importance of not seeing such a hopeful creature in
  such a sad place. The word “ghettoized” is an uncomfortable term and not a very
  common term, and I thought it fit perfectly with the literal awkwardness of the
  German language and what the poem meant, but I wanted to make sure the readers understood
  the term stick outs by making the word a bit smaller than the rest.</p>"
abio: "<p>Pavel Friedmann was a Jewish Czechslovakian poet who was famous for his
  poem “Der Schmetterling.” Very little is known about his early life. When he was
  twenty-one, he was transported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp located
  in Prague. This poem was found on a very thin piece of paper along with a lot of
  other drawings and writings from Jewish children at the camp. Pavel Friedmann was
  later transported to Auschwitz in 1944, where he died.</p>"
tbio: "<p>My name is Karina Carreras, and I am a senior at the University of Iowa.
  This semester, I decided to take a translation course not thinking a lot of it,
  and I ended up falling in love with translation. I didn't realize how captivating
  the art of translation was until I started working with pieces and workshopping
  them with my peers and professor. I wanted to submit this translation because it
  was so moving in German, and I think English readers should have the chance to read
  this as well.</p>"
