subtitle: on translating Mariama Ndiaye
note: "<p>Three years ago, I translated the poem “Femme Noir” by Léopold Senghor for
  the 2018 edition of <em>DoubleSpeak</em>. When I found this poem by Ndiaye, I felt
  that it was a near perfect follow-up to my first translation, as it offers both
  a call to arms and love for Black women (specifically those from Africa) from the
  perspective of a Black woman. I tried my best to maintain the high-energy and fast-paced
  nature of the poem in my translation by keeping the lines to a similar length and
  retaining the same punctuation and structure. I also chose to translate all of the
  lines starting with <em>femme</em> as “Women of” to add repetition to the poem to
  keep it moving forward. I also tried to as closely as possible preserve the meanings
  of the more descriptive words like <em>crépitements</em>, which directly translates
  to “the crackling of machine guns.” However, I chose to use the word “sputter” in
  my translation because I felt it more accurately captured in English the sound she
  was trying to evoke. Similarly, while <em>ni decolorées</em> literally translates
  to “neither faded,” the line was difficult to translate as there is no meaningful
  English equivalent to this use of the past tense. I opted to use the phrase “left
  to fade,” as I believe it more accurately captures the feeling of the original line.
  Finally, I sifted through several different English translation of the line: “VIVE
  L’AFRIQUE LIBRE” (“long live free Africa,” “God bless free Africa,” etc.), but ultimate
  settled on translating <em>libre</em> as “liberated” as it felt like it carried
  the most nuanced understanding of what it means for Africa and Black women to be
  free.</p>"
abio: "<p>Mariam Ndiaye is a Senegalese poet and politician. Unfortunately, this was
  the extent of the information I was able to find about her through the Internet.
  These poems were sourced from an anthology of Senegalese poetry published by the
  Senegalese Center of P.E.N. International.</p>"
