  Kālu’pẙṭhu’ cī kitsh vẙkhu’ts vạ̄nākh rāth
  Rạ̄ts hund pot pạhar gaṭu’ zạli

  Thạ̄vmu’ts ạ̄s mạ̄ntu’rạ̄vith śīntsrạ̄vith kāyināth
  kāvrēmu’ts sarzamīn ḍạjmu’ts ḥẙsav

  Ghạ̄b tārakh nab nu’ kuni ākạ̄śigang
  Kālu’ obran nāl volmut āvrith śanvay taraf

  Ạchdaran hu’ndi ạ̄s vạhrith
  Ḍōnṭhu’ chapu’ mạnzi rūdu’ traṭu’ gagrāyi grẙni

  Kot gatshan bēcāru’ bēgar rāh musāfir kot gatshan
  Vānu’ penjan pẙṭh vọthān tim vūri vūri rạ̄tirātas

  Natu’ zacal khū’man andar
  Kuli gọgar ālẙn andar śrepith karān zip’ jānvār

  Chus divān lari phirni kun zon jānvār
  Kamli tal yath zạdi tu’vuli

  Khū’mu’ kūnjas manz me ditsmu’ts śāndu’ sīr
  Karsanā phọli gāś bulbul kar pican

  Ḍōnṭhu’ tsādar zantu’ kani śāvay karān
  Hōś kạritav yithu’ nabā gari nēri kānh

  Chusbu’ prārān
  Karsanā gatshi mandru’cē ganṭāyi ṭhas

  Masjidi manz diyi bạ̄ngi bang
  Bod chu day al-lāhu akbar gatshi kanan

  Saḥru’ waqtan siryi sakhrith
  Cāri beyi lāqam rathas

  Vuni nu’ vuni sognẙār kari yiyi sāsu’ gāś
  Chalu’vạdu’r gatshi kālu’obras trāvi dav

  Vọlru’ kẙn malran vuniundur gav sẙṭhāh

  Bāmbrith beyi obru’ longi chali chali gatshan
  Nal nakh phuṭith phambu’ tombi zabarvan bālu’ pẙṭhi
transpoem: |-
  Since last evening, what a devious, threatening night
  The last, darkest hour of the night

  We had kept consecrated and orderly the universe
  Trembling the blessed land, its consciousness lost

  Disappeared the starry sky, nowhere the Milky Way
  Dark clouds have enveloped and busied all the six directions

  The pythons’ mouths are open
  In hailstorms, though sheets of rain, in the thunderstorm

  Where will the poor and unhoused wayfarers go, where will they go
  From the thresholds of the shops, they leave for faraway places all night
  ​
  Or inside ragged tents
  In tree-holds, shrinking, birds doze

  I toss-and-turn, a lone bird
  Once under the blanket, torn and holey

  In a corner of the tent, my pillow a brick
  When will the light dawn, when the bulbul sing

  The hailstorm seems to rain stones
  Beware, let no one leave the house​

  I am waiting
  When will the temple bell sound

  From the mosque, the muezzin will call
  God is Great, Allah-o-Akbar, ears will hear

  At dawn, the sun prepares
  Pulls on the chariot’s reins

  Just about now, a soft light will spread
  The dark clouds will be scattered, will flee

  The waves of the Wular have slept badly long enough
  Now they will settle quietly, calmly, peacefully

  Now they will bloom, the hill tops will wear bright garlands
  Lightning’s edge will disappear in the Apharwat hills*

  Scurrying again, banks of clouds will dissipate
  Limbs broken, they will turn cotton puffs over the Zabarwan hills**

  *The Gulmarg hills
  **The Srinagar hills
