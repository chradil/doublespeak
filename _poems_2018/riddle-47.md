  <h1>Translated by Raymond Ohl</h1>
  Letters have nourished me, but I know not what letters are. I have lived in books, but am no more studious thereby. I have devoured the Muses, and yet so far have not myself made progress.

  <h1>Translated by Paull Franklin Baum</h1>
  A moth ate words.     To me it seemed
  a remarkable fate,     when I learned of the marvel,
  that the worm had swallowed     the speech of a man,
  a thief in the night,     a renowned saying
  and its place itself.     Though he swallowed the word
  the thieving stranger     was no whit the wiser.

  <h1>Translated by Samantha Pious</h1>
  To me it seemed a wondrous thing
  a little moth went plundering
  — as though a burglar in the night —
  the words a lettered man did write.
  Not only does it eat his speech
  it even takes the place in which
  the speech was given, going through
  the parchment and the binding too,
  devouring all the craft and art
  of the scribe, who worked so hard
  to scan the verse, to find the rhymes,
  that you might be inclined to mind
  the teachings crammed in every line.
  If you want to read good books,
  you ought to curse that beast, that crook,
  that greedy moth who dares to scoff
  the text, the heading, and the gloss!
  Still, swallow though he may, he’s dumb
  and won’t grow wiser by a crumb!
note: |-
  <p>The Old English poem presented here is one of almost a hundred verse riddles preserved in a tenth-century manuscript known as the Exeter Book. Its modern-day editors, George Philip Krapp and Elliott Van Kirk Dobbie, titled it “Riddle 47” in the third volume of the <em>Anglo-Saxon Poetic Records</em> (1936). In <em>Sources and Analogues of Old English Poetry</em> (1976), Michael Allen and Daniel Calder trace its origins to a late–Classical Latin riddle by Symphosius (late fourth or early fifth century), which is available in Raymond Ohl’s edition and translation (1928).</p>

  <p>The riddle’s answer (Latin <em>tinea</em>, Old English <em>moððe</em>, Modern English “book moth”) is obvious, but, as Patrick Murphy points out in <em>Unriddling the Exeter Riddles</em> (2005), it seems less important to get the solution right than to contemplate the paradox of an animal “devouring” words but not “ruminating” on them. Indeed, consuming without contemplating is more or less what the book moth does.</p>

  <p>This translation began as a thought experiment for Old English Live, an annual celebration organized by Emily Steiner at the University of Pennsylvania where participants share creative reimaginings of Old English poetry. At Professor Steiner’s suggestion, I decided to translate an Old English riddle into Middle French, as though I were a fourteenth-century poet. I imagined myself as Eustache Deschamps or Oton de Granson stumbling on an undiscovered copy of the Exeter Book riddles in the royal library of King Charles V and wondering what language, let alone what form or genre, he was looking at. Perhaps he would have managed to locate a copy of the riddle in its original Latin and been able to decipher the Old English from there.</p>

  <p>Of course, translation practices in the fourteenth century were very different from what they are today. Middle French narrative couplets tend to lend themselves to far more prolixity than Old English alliterative verse, and I’m afraid the poet may have allowed his feelings to run away with him. The French riddle is twenty lines — more than twice the length of its Old English source, to say nothing of the Latin original!</p>

  <p>Finally, I’ve added a relatively faithful Modern English translation of the “Middle French” version — except that, for better or worse, I embellished the English verse with far more internal rhymes than there are in the source text. Am I as flighty as the book moth? Or did I contemplate too much?</p>
abio: "<p>Symphosius was the author of a renowned collection of one hundred Latin
  riddles, entitled <em>Aenigmata</em>. The collection was most likely written in
  the late antique period. Many of the riddles, along with their solutions, have been
  transmitted.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Samantha Pious is a doctoral student in comparative literature at the University
  of Pennsylvania. Her first book, <em>A Crown of Violets</em> (Headmistress Press,
  2017) offers a selection of verse translations from the French poetry of Renée Vivien.
  Some of her translations and poems have appeared in <em>Berkeley Poetry Review</em>,
  <em>Lavender Review</em>, <em>Lunch Ticket</em>, <em>Mezzo Cammin</em>, and other
  publications.</p>\n"
