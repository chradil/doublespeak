pid: you-are-not-poetry
title: Poesía no eres tú
transtitle: You Are Not Poetry
author: Rosario Castellanos
translator: Stephanie Diaz
poem: |-
  Porque si tú existieras
  tendría que existir yo también. Y eso es mentira.

  Nada hay más que nosotros: la pareja,
  los sexos conciliados en un hijo,
  las dos cabezas juntas, pero no contemplándose
  (para no convertir a nadie en un espejo)
  sino mirando frente a sí, hacia el otro.

  El otro: mediador, juez, equilibrio
  entre opuestos, testigo,
  nudo en el que se anuda lo que se había roto.

  El otro, la mudez que pide voz
  al que tiene la voz
  y reclama el oído del que escucha.

  El otro. Con el otro
  la humanidad, el diálogo, la poesía, comienzan.
transpoem: "Because if you existed,\nI would also have to, and that is wrong.\n\nNothing
  but us: the couple, \nsexes reconciled in a child,\nheads together, neither studying
  the other\n(to avoid turning into a mirror)\ninstead looking ahead towards each
  other.\n\nThe other: mediator, judge, balance\nbetween opposites. Witness, knot\nin
  which the broken is tied.\n\nThe other: muteness that asks\na voice of he who has
  one\nand demands the ear of he who listens\n\nThe other. With whom\nhumanity, dialogue,
  and poetry begin."
note: |
  <p>Above all, this poem seemed both intensely personal and yet widely universal. In this poem Castellanos addresses her quarrels with the concept of what a relationship is and what this means to her existence as an individual. I think that it’s particularly important to consider the time and place in which “Poesía no eres tú” was created, as the role of women at this point in time was often very restrictive.</p>
  <p>In translating this poem, I stumbled on the first stanza because of the line “Y eso es mentira.” First of all, the line begins with the word “and,” a conjunction which every elementary teacher clearly told me should never start a sentence. In the original version I found that <em>y</em> has a more disruptive quality because the sharp sound of its pronunciation does not allow you to rest after the end of the first sentence, but instead pushes you into Castellanos’ next definitive line. Secondly, the sentence itself is a bit tricky since it does not use an article. Literally, the line reads “And that is lie.” To clear up this issue, I first tried to simply insert the article and say, “And that is a lie.” However, I found that this version did not quite pack the same punch that Castellano’s did. I then realized that what made her version so impactful was that I could imagine the lines being spoken in an argument, so my translation of “and that is <em>wrong</em>” was my effort to replicate this effect.</p>
abio: "<p>Rosario Castellanos, born in 1925, was a Mexican writer and diplomat who
  is considered one of Mexico’s most important authors and poets. Castellanos wrote
  on topics including Mexican culture and gender, often focusing on the intersection
  and implications of being a Mexican woman. Another subject which Castellanos highlighted
  in her works was the indigenous population of her native Chiapas. In addition to
  addressing injustices committed against this population, Castellanos also worked
  with the National Indigenous Institute to improve literacy in this region. In her
  later years Castellano served as the Mexican ambassador to Israel.</p>"
