poem: "Die Käfer der Nacht\nkommen.\nSie wandern über deine Hände in die Welt.\nEs
  hat ein Wind dich quer\ngelegt über die Schluchten.\nDu bist die Brücke und du weißt
  es nicht. \n\nSo schlaf denn, schlafe: Wimpern sind kein Zeichen mehr.\n\nEs hat
  ein Wind dich quer \ngelegt über die Schluchten.\nDu bist die Brücke, doch du weißt
  es nicht.\n\nDie Käfer der Nacht\nkommen."
transpoem: |-
  The beetles of the night
  come flying.
  They wander across your hands into the world.
  A wind has blown you by,
  laid you across the canyon.
  You are the bridge and you don’t know it.

  Sleep well then, sleep: eyelashes cease to signify.

  A wind has blown you by,
  laid you across the canyon.
  You are the bridge, truly you don’t know it.

  The beetles of the night
  come flying.
note: "<p>The most difficult task in translating this poem was preserving its ambiguity.
  When translating, you choose to phrase a line in one way rather than another, and
  the new language assigns meaning to the poem. Especially when a poem is deeply metaphorical,
  it can be difficult to separate the task of translation from the task of interpretation.
  “Wimpern sind kein Zeichen mehr,” for example, might also have been translated to
  “lashes lose significance” or, more literally, “lashes are no longer signs.” All
  have quite different implications, none of which are wrong. In the end, “lashes
  cease to signify” won in order to preserve the rhyme with lines four and eight.</p>"
abio: "<p>Paul Celan was born in 1920 in Chernivsti, the capital of Bukovina, formerly
  northern Romania. Because Romania’s medical faculty was closed to him as a Jewish
  man, Celan began his first years of university study in France in 1938–1939. The
  Soviet Union occupied Bukovina in 1940, with Chernivtsi later coming under German
  occupation in 1941. Celan’s parents were sent to forced labor camps in June 1942;
  his father died some months later from typhus, and his mother was killed by an SS
  guard. Celan was sent to a forced labor battalion in northeast Romania from the
  summer of 1942 until early 1944. In 1945, Celan relocated to Bucharest, where he
  translated Russian into Romanian and published his first poems. Before moving to
  Paris in 1948, Celan lived in Vienna, his only residence with German as its exclusive
  vernacular language. His departure from Vienna was an attempt to leave behind his
  youth and its unbearable memories of war and his parents’ deaths. This geographic
  and emotional move is also manifested as a break between Celan’s early and later
  poetic works. Paul Celan died in Paris in April, 1970.</p>"

  in creative writing and medieval studies from the University of Pennsylvania in
  2017. She is currently teaching English in Nuremberg, Germany.</p>"
