  <h1>Canto primo</h1>
  O sorella dell’ombra,
  Notturna quanto più la luce ha forza,
  M’insegui, morte.
  In un giardino puro
  Alla luce ti diè l’ingenua brama
  E la pace fu persa,
  Pensosa morte,
  Sulla tua bocca.
  Da quel momento
  Ti odo nel fluire della mente
  Approfondite lontananze,
  Emula sofferente dell’eterno.
  Madre velenosa degli evi
  Nella paura del palpito
  E della solitudine,
  Bellezza punita e ridente,
  Nell’assopirsi della carne
  Sognatrice fuggente,
  Atleta senza sonno
  Della nostra grandezza,
  Quando m’avrai domato, dimmi:
  Nella malinconia dei vivi
  Volerà a lungo la mia ombra?
  <h1>Canto secondo</h1>
  Scava le intime vite
  Della nostra infelice maschera
  (clausura d’infinito)
  Con blandizia fanatica
  La buia veglia dei padri.
  Morte, muta parola,
  Sabbia deposta come un letto
  Dal sangue,
  Ti odo cantare come una cicala
  Nella rosa abbrunata dei riflessi.
  <h1>Canto terzo</h1>
  Incide le rughe segrete
  Della nostra infelice maschera
  La beffa infinita dei padri.
  Tu, nella luce fonda,
  O confuso silenzio,
  Insisti come le cicale irose.
  <h1>Canto quarto</h1>
  Mi presero per mano nuvole.
  Brucio sul colle spazio e tempo,
  Come un tuo messaggero,
  Come il sogno, divina morte.
  <h1>Canto quinto</h1>
  Hai chiuso gli occhi.
  Nasce una morte
  Piena di finte buche,
  Di suoni morti,
  Come di sugheri
  Di reti calate nell’acqua.
  Le tue mani si fanno come un soffio
  D’inviolabili lontananze,
  Inafferrabili come le idee,
  E l’equivoco della luna
  E il dondolio, dolcissimi,
  Se vuoi posarmele sugli occhi,
  Toccano l’anima.
  Sei la donna che passa
  Come una foglia
  E lasci agli alberi un fuoco d’autunno.
  <h1>Canto sesto</h1>
  O bella preda,
  Voce notturna,
  Le tue movenze
  Fomentano la febbre.
  Solo tu, memoria demente,
  La libertà potevi catturare.
  Sulla tua carne inafferrabile
  E vacillante dentro specchi torbidi,
  Quali delitti, sogno,
  Non m’insegnasti a consumare?
  Con voi, fantasmi, non ho mai ritegno,
  E dei vostri rimorsi ho pieno il cuore
  Quando fa giorno.

  <h1>First Canto</h1>
  O sister of shadow,
  darker in the brightest of lights,
  you chase me, death.
  In an untouched garden
  naive craving bore you,
  and peace,
  pensive death,
  was lost on your mouth.
  Since that moment
  I have heard you in the flows of my mind
  deepening distances,
  aching imitator of the eternity.
  Venomous mother of ages,
  in the fear of throb
  and loneliness,
  punished and laughing Beauty,
  in the slumber of flesh,
  fugitive dreamer,
  sleepless athlete
  of our greatness,
  once you have tamed me, tell me:
  Will my shadow fly long
  in the melancholy of the living?
  <h1>Second Canto</h1>
  The dark vigil of our fathers
  with its crazy blandishments
  hollows out the intimate lives
  of our unhappy mask
  (enclosure of the infinite).
  Death, still word,
  sand laid as a bed
  by blood,
  I hear you singing like a locust
  in the darkened rose of reflections.
  <h1>Third Canto</h1>
  The eternal deception of our fathers
  Engraves secret wrinkles
  On our unhappy masks.
  In the broad light,
  you, confused silence,
  insist like tense locusts.
  <h1>Fourth Canto</h1>
  Clouds took me by the hand.
  Upon the hill, I consume space and time
  like your harbinger,
  like a dream, divine death.
  <h1>Fifth canto</h1>
  You have closed your eyes.
  A night is born,
  a night full of false holes,
  of dead sounds,
  like corks
  of nets dropped into the water.
  Your hands become a breath
  of inviolable distances,
  as unreachable as ideas,
  and the moon’s ambiguity
  and its swinging — so tender —
  if you want to lay them on my eyes,
  they touch my soul.
  You are the woman
  who goes by like a leaf
  and you leave the trees like a fire during fall.
  <h1>Sixth canto</h1>
  O beautiful prey,
  nocturnal voice,
  the way you move
  raises my fever.
  Only you, demented memory,
  could capture freedom.
  On your flesh, unreachable
  and wavering in turbid mirrors,
  what crimes, dream,
  didn’t you lead me to commit?
  With you, ghosts, I have no restraint
  and my heart is filled with your remorse
  when a new day rises.

  <p>As usually happens when translating poetry, the title is the first challenge presented
  to the translator, and “La morte meditata” is no exception. First of all, one wonders what
  “la morte meditata” actually means. I believe the meaning of the title is closely connected
  to the act of reflecting on something, to meditate on what on what all human beings have
  in common — mortality. At some point of their lives, all people question themselves about
  death. This why I decided to translate the title as “The Meditated Death.” It does not
  refer to death per se, but, more precisely, it refers to that meditated death that inevitably
  becomes part of people’s thoughts.</p>
  <p>The poem is divided into six <em>canti</em>, which I decided to keep as “canto.” The most
  obvious and literal translation would be “song,” but I do not think it gives justice to
  Ungaretti’s word choice. Furthermore, the word “canto” echoes the one hundred cantos of
  Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em> — at least to the ears of an Italian speaker — and I think it is a fair
  tribute to the Italian literary tradition. One of the lines I liked the most is the fifth line of
  the second canto, where death is defined as <em>muta parola</em> — “mute word.” It is an
  exceptionally powerful and paradoxical image, full of tension: How can a word be mute? It
  can be so before it is spoken, when a word is still an idea, but it is nonetheless striking to
  the reader. Instead of opting for “mute,” the most straightforward equivalent, I preferred
  using “still.” It is such an interesting word in English, because it conveys both the meaning
  related to the sound, but also the idea of steadiness. And of course, nothing can be as
  steady and motionless as death.</p>
abio: |-
  <p>Giuseppe Ungaretti was born on February 10, 1888, in Alexandria, Egypt, from an Italian family originating from Lucca (Tuscany). The multicultural and cosmopolitan city of Alexandria had a considerable influence both on his life and on his work. Ungaretti is mostly known in Italy as “Il poeta Ssldato,” that is, “the soldier poet.” In 1915, in fact, when Italy joined World War I, he decided to volunteer. World War I left a mark on his life. He got to know both the suffering of war, but also the true meaning of brotherhood.</p>
  <p>Giuseppe Ungaretti is certainly one of the most appreciated Italian poets of the twentieth century. Students remember him for writing very short and incisive poems, but what makes him so great is his experience of war that gave a very introspective cut to his poetry.</p>
tbio: "<p>My name is Carla Rossi, I’m twenty-five, and I’m from Italy. Last year I
  spent the spring semester at Penn, and I fell in love with it. I’ve just graduated
  from the University of Bologna in conference interpreting, with a concentration
  in English and Spanish — so I mostly translate speeches from English and Spanish
  into Italian (but also the other way around). In my free time I like playing with
  words, talking to my friends, and planning my next travel.</p>"
