  <h1>VI</h1>

  Ces liens d’or, ceste bouche vermeille,
  Pleine de lis, de roses, et d’œuilletz,
  Et ces couraulx chastement vermeilletz,
  Et ceste joue à l’Aurore pareille:
  Ces mains, ce col, ce front, et ceste oreille,
  Et de ce sein les boutons verdeletz,
  Et de ces yeulx les astres jumeletz,
  Qui font trembler les ames de merveille :
  Feirent nicher Amour dedans mon sein,
  Qui gros de germe avoit le ventre plein,
  D’œufz non formez et de glaires nouvelles.
  Et luy couvant (qui de mon cuœur jouit
  Neuf mois entiers) en un jour m’eclouit
  Mille amoureaux chargez de traits et d’aisles.

  <h1>VII</h1>

  Bien qu’à grand tort il te plaist d’allumer
  Dedans mon cuœur, siege à ta seigneurie,
  Non d’une amour, ainçois d’une furie
  Le feu cruel pour mes os consumer,
  L’aspre torment ne m’est point si amer,
  Qu’il ne me plaise, et si n’ay pas envie
  De me douloir : car je n’ayme ma vie
  Si non d’autant qu’il te plaist de l’aimer.
  Mais si les cieulx m’ont fait naistre, Ma dame,
  Pour estre tien, ne genne plus mon ame,
  Mais pren en gré ma ferme loyaulté.
  Vault il pas mieulx en tirer du service,
  Que par l’horreur d’un cruel sacrifice,
  L’occire aux piedz de ta fiere beauté ?

  <h1>VIII</h1>

  Lors que mon œil pour t’œillader s’amuse,
  Le tien habile à ses traits decocher,
  Estrangement m’empierre en un rocher,
  Comme au regard d’une horrible Meduse.
  Moy donc rocher, si dextrement je n’use
  L’outil des Seurs pour ta gloire esbaucher,
  Qu’un seul Tuscan est digne de toucher.
  Non le changé, mais le changeur accuse
  Las qu’ay je dit ? Dans un roc emmuré,
  En te blamant je ne suis asseuré,
  Tant j’ay grand peur des flammes de ton ire,
  Et que mon chef par le feu de tes yeux
  Soit diffamé, comme les monts d’Epire
  Sont diffamez par les flammes des cieulx.

  <h1>VI</h1>

  These vermillion lips, these golden rings,
  Full of lilies, roses, and carnations,
  And corals of scarlet colorations,
  And this cheek, Aurore’s own, to my mind brings:
  These hands, this neck, this chest, this ear, these things,
  From this bosom, a green button blazons,
  And from these eyes, the heavens’ conjunctions,
  That make tremble even the souls of kings:
  Ensconced is the Love within my bosom,
  Thou filled with seed, has a stomach buxom,
  With eggs yet unformed and glairs newly made.
  As it develops (my heart rejoices
  Nine whole months) and in one day produces
  A thousand lovers with wings and bolts staid.

  <h1>VII</h1>

  Although with great pain thou wish to ignite
  Within my heart, the seat of thy power,
  Not of love, more so that of a furor
  The cruel fire, to my bones consume, so bright,
  Sheer torment is not so bitter to bite,
  That it displeases me and if it were
  To sadden me: I love life, my flower,
  Only as much as it serves thy delight.
  But if the skies birthed me, I cajole,
  To be yours, do not bother my poor soul,
  Take confidence in my firm loyalty.
  Is it not better to find in service,
  Than by the horror of cruel sacrifice,
  Sweet death at the feet of thy proud beauty?

  <h1>VIII</h1>

  My eye wanders and alights upon thee,
  Given to such sudden movements, thine own,
  Strangely imprisons me, as if in stone,
  As Medusa’s horrid gaze upon me.
  Thus become rock, I cannot play nimbly
  The Muses’ lyre, to thy glory intone,
  Played by Tuscans, worthy was he alone.
  Not the changèd, the changer, proclaims she,
  Alas, what have I said? Walled within rock,
  I blame thee, but am not assured by talk,
  Such is my great fear of flames of thine ire,
  And that my name, by the fire in thine eyes
  Be defamed. Epirus’s peaks, ever higher
  Were defamèd by the flames in the skies.

  <p>In French, there are two separate words for describing the rewriting of literature from one language to another. There is <em>traduction</em>, which is simply translating the meaning of a string of words from one language to another. One has the freedom to change the syntax, grammar, word choice, and even rhyme scheme in a <em>traduction</em>. The other word to describe such a process is <em>translation</em>, which means rewriting the work in another language while maintaining the original artistry, such as the rhyme scheme, the word choice, the rhythm, and flow. In essence, in a <em>translation</em>, one is writing poetry of one’s own, using the original as a baseline. In this case, I have chosen to do a <em>translation</em> of three sonnets from Pierre de Ronsard’s collection <em>Les Amours</em>. Written in <em>Moyen Français</em>, or Middle French, in the mid-sixteenth century, <em>Les Amours</em> is a collection of sonnets describing Ronsard’s love for a young woman named Cassandre. What Beatrice is to Dante, what Laure is to Petrarch, Cassandre is to Ronsard. He poured all his creative gifts into describing her virtues and beauty in these sonnets, a style of poem heavily influenced by Petrarch and Shakespeare before him. I chose these three sonnets to give a glimpse into Ronsard’s mastery of the genre. His succinct yet vague declarations of love tug at the heartstrings and depict love through a variety of lenses: physical, spiritual, and philosophical.</p>
  <p>I attempted to keep with Ronsard’s original poetry by keeping the decasyllabic form throughout the three sonnets. Every line is ten syllables long and follows the same rhyme scheme as the original. The first two quatrains are ABBAABBA, the next couplet is always CC, and the final quatrain alternates between DEED and DEDE. Finally, I attempted to keep with the time period and used the informal, ancient form “thou” for any parallel usage in the original French. What strikes me the most about Ronsard’s creativity, is that it holds true for tales and clichés of <em>amour</em> even today, nearly five hundred years later.</p>
abio: "<p>Pierre de Ronsard was born in 1524 in a small village known as Couture-Sur-Loir,
  on the banks of the Loir River. Ronsard finished his education in Paris and quickly
  made a name for himself as a great poet. Growing up in Renaissance France, he started
  his career under Madeleine de France as a translator of classical works into vernacular
  languages. After her death, he found himself in Paris and slowly made acquaintances
  with several other up-and-coming poets and authors of the time, including Antoine
  de Baïf, Pontus de Tyard, Joachim du Bellay, and Étienne Jodelle, among others.
  This group came to be called <em>La Pléiade</em>, modeled after the Alexandrian
  Pleiad of ancient times. Ronsard was the founding member of the group, and has since
  been known as one of the greatest lyricists of French history. Today, <em>La Pléiade</em>
  forms an essential part of the French literary canon and is studied by French literature
  students of all levels.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Saagar Asnani is a junior in the College of Arts and Sciences at Penn studying
  biology, French, and music. He has always considered himself an avid Francophile
  at heart, and more recently a medievalist, concentrating much of his French studies
  on the Middle Ages and Renaissance, mostly in the realm of literature. Having spent
  a semester in Lyon studying the works of poets like Ronsard and Chrétien de Troyes,
  he wishes to make these masterpieces accessible to a wider audience and to translate
  more works from Middle and Old French into English. He plays viola in various groups
  across campus, including the Penn Symphony, and intends to go to medical school
  after finishing his undergraduate education.</p>\n"
