transtitle: Wild Grass
author: Lu Xun (鲁迅)
translator: Chardonnay Needler
poem: "当我沉默着的时候，我觉得充实；我将开口，同时感到空虚 。 \n\r\n过去的生命已经死亡。我对于这死亡有大欢喜，因为我借此知道它曾经存活。死亡的生命已经朽腐。我对于这朽腐有大欢喜，因为我借此知道它还非空虚。
  \r\n生命的泥委弃在地面上，不生乔木，只生野草，这是我的罪过。 \n\r\n野草，根本不深，花叶不美，然而吸取露，吸取水，吸取陈死人的血和肉，各各夺取它的生存。当生存时，还是将遭践踏，将遭删刈，直至于死亡而朽腐。
  \r\n但我坦然，欣然。我将大笑，我将歌唱。 \n\r\n我自爱我的野草，但我憎恶这以野草作装饰的地面。 \n\r\n地火在地下运行，奔突；熔岩一旦喷出，将烧尽一切野草，以及乔木，于是并且无可朽腐。但我坦然，欣然。我将大笑，我将歌唱。
  \n\r\n天地有如此静穆，我不能大笑而且歌唱。天地即不如此静穆，我或者也将不能。我以这一丛野草，在明与暗，生与死，过去与未来之际，献于友与仇，人与兽，爱者与不爱者之前作证。
  \n\r\n为我自己，为友与仇，人与兽，爱者与不爱者，我希望这野草的死亡与朽腐，火速到来。要 不然，我先就未曾生存，这实在比死亡与朽腐更其不幸。 \r\n去罢，野草，连着我的题辞！"
transpoem: "Day 1\nI'm not afraid of you,\nI've seen the collapse \nof more impressive
  things\nthan your prejudice.\n\nDay 15\nI write unlove poems \nto my craft\nthat
  made me promises and didn't keep them.\nI write unlove poems \nto the political
  movements\nwhere I sought refuge and didn't find it.\nI write unlove poems \nto
  my old poems\nthat haven't got the strength I need \nthem to send me from the past.\nI
  don't write those poems \nto the people I loved:\nfor them the promise\nthat I will
  keep holding on to hopes\nas if we hadn't learned together \nthat almost everything
  ends badly.\n\nDay 20\nMy high-school history \nteacher\nwas also a writer and used
  to say\nwe needed to grow up to tell\nour story outside\nthe jar of mayonnaise.\nI
  was never sure\nwhat he meant by it:\nthe school run by nuns,\nthe suburbs,\nthe
  middle class.\nI made an effort to get out\nof the jar\nto look at it in perspective\nto
  understand what was inside it\nand what was outside.\nI couldn't,\nwherever I go\nmy
  context comes with me\nI think I don't want to tell\nmy adventures outside the jar\nI
  want to show\nhow I see the world from there.\n\nDay 25\nI don't post poems\non
  social media\nsays someone whom I don't \nknow where they think poems should be:\nin
  a closed book\nin a university\nin the hands of critics\nin a drawer\nwhere no one
  can find them\n“who doesn't deserve them.”\nI don't want\nto leave my poems anywhere\nthey
  can't be \nfound by anyone, for instance me\nat age thirteen, at fifteen\nwhen I
  didn't know which books to buy\nwhen I lived in Ciudadela\nwhen I didn't read poetry."
