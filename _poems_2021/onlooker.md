transpoem: "The suspicious odyssey of an onlooker \nWearing a broad-brimmed straw
  hat in the northern summer\nIs reaching its climax — sometimes punctuated by peaks\nOtherwise
  concealed by a gloomy canyon —\nAnd is obviously slowing down\nWhile gradually approaching
  a desert\n\nA prairie on one side and a sandy land on the other\nThe views bewilder
  him who also witnesses\nA river wagging its tail and a startled lizard \nToo desperate
  to choose its path\nTravel together, hurriedly vanishing into the distance\n\nIt
  is when a truck faster than a river rushes by\nThat I behold the onlooker, his bewilderment\nUnconcealable
  by the shadow under his broad-brimmed straw hat\nAnd his abruptly stopped journey\nWith
  an apex mingled with slight abjection"
poem: "戴宽边草帽的瞭望者\n他的可疑的行程    在夏天的北方\n走向高潮    他的忽而被群峰突出\n忽而又被幽暗的峡谷藏匿的行程\n在渐渐靠近沙漠时\n明显地慢下来了
  \       \n\n一边是草原    一边是沙地的情景\n令他迷惑    他看见\n一条河流摇摆着尾巴\n和一条受惊的慌不择路的蜥蜴\n他们结伴而行    消失般地奔赴远处\n\n我是在一辆比河流跑得更快的卡车\n一晃而过时看到瞭望者的
  \   我看到了宽边草帽下\n他的阴影都掩饰不住的迷惑\n和他的在高潮中夹杂着些许落魄\n而忽然停下来的旅程"
