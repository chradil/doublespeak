                                      赏
                              暮              花
                    已                                  归
           时                                                   去
  醒                                                    马
          微                                   如
                    力                 飞
                               酒

  赏花归去马如飞
  去马如飞酒力微
  酒力微醒时已暮
  醒时已暮赏花归
transpoem: "Enjoy\nDusk                Flower\nAlready                        Come\nTime
  \                               Back\nWaking                                Horse\nSlightly
  \                       Like\nImpact                Flying\nWine\n\n\nA Chain Verse
  \n\nOutside, enjoying the flowers, then coming back\non a horse, running, running,
  almost flying.\nThe  sprightly horse seems like it’s flying;\nthe impact of the
  wine \nis fading. My drunken\nfog is clearing; \nthe hour \nis already \nlate.\nWhen\n
  I woke, \nit was already dusk,\nand I’ve come back from enjoying the flowers. \n"
