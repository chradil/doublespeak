transpoem: "I. \nO gazelle, tasting leaves,\nhere in the green of my garden.\nLook
  at my eyes. Dark and lonely,\njust as yours are. \nHow distant we are from our beloveds,
  and how forgotten\nStanding in the night,\nWaiting for fate to find us.\n\nII.\nThe
  garden is filled with fruit on the vines, but the gardener\nrefuses to brush a finger
  over the skin of even one piece.\nHow sad it is! The season of splendor passes,\nand
  the fruit that ripens only in darkness\nRemains lonely. "
