  一只白天鹅
  （也许仅仅是一个类似的白乎乎的事物）
  和它的不太真实的白
  在秋天的天池里
  在比新疆还远的地方
  和镜子睡在一起

  一块有弯度的巨石和它的黑青苔
  和一大堆白花花的鸟粪
  在大河上空的危崖上
  在古代的风中    在一只试图确定
  飞翔姿态的鸟的翅翼下
  和时间睡在一起

  一条蛇在丛林中蜕掉白皮
  （这一切只是在想象之中）
  追逐一只饥饿的老虎未果
  在迷失了返回洞穴的道路之后
  由于恐惧而仓皇逃窜
  天黑之前它要赶到旷野上
  和乌云    月亮睡在一起

  我父亲和他的白发
  以及他的黑皮中的白骨
  今夜在故乡的梦中和我的梦中
  闪着无处安放的白花花的寒光
  和某种难以名状的忧伤
  和北方的群山睡在一起

  A white swan
  (Or maybe just a similar whitish thing)
  And its somewhat unreal whiteness
  In an autumn heavenly lake
  A place farther than Xinjiang
  Are sleeping with a mirror

  A massive, curved boulder with black moss
  And a large heap of shining-white bird droppings
  On a precipitous cliff above a great river
  In the ancient wind, under the wings
  Of a bird determining its flight gesture
  Are sleeping with time

  A snake having sloughed off its white skin in a jungle
  (All these exist only in imagination)
  Fruitlessly chased a hungry tiger
  Lost its way back to its pit
  And hence fled hurriedly out of fright
  Needs to hasten to the moors before night falls
  To sleep with gloomy clouds and the moon

  My father and his grey hair
  As well as his white bones under his dark skin
  All glittering with chilling white shimmers
  With nowhere to rest
  And with certain indescribable melancholy
  In the homeland’s dreams and mine tonight
  Are sleeping with the northern mountains
