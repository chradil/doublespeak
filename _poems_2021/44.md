poem: "重复生活的危险性\r\n就在于记忆容易被消磁\r\n我已经不记得昨天的事了\r\n就像昨天不存在似的\r\n今天是封城的第76天\r\n也是最后一日\r\n我坐在家里就像\r\n坐在城外的空地上\r\n阳光明艳照见我有泪水\r\n我必须眯上眼睛使劲看\r\n才能依稀看见\r\n一个未亡人\r\n闪烁在地平线上的影子\r\n扭曲，失真，不成人形\r\n当他越走越近时\r\n我会站起身来\r\n奔过去\r\n与他相拥而泣\r\n2020-4-7\r"

  The danger of life repeating itself
  is that memory is prone to degaussing
  I already do not remember what happened yesterday
  as if yesterday did not exist
  Today is the 76th day of the lockdown
  also the last day
  I sit at home just like
  sitting in the open field outside of the city
  The sun’s brilliance shines on my tears
  I have to squint really hard
  to barely see
  the shadow of a survived man
  blinking on the horizon
  Distorted, untrue, no longer in a human form
  When he comes near,
  I’ll get on my feet
  run over to him
  and embrace him with tears
