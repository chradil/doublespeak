transtitle: Excerpts from <em>Va où</em>
author: Valérie Rezeau
translator: Malika Kadyrova
poem: |-
  Quand je passerai je voudrais bien avoir de ma vie fait mon tour
  Aimé aimé gratuitement passionnément et pas du tout aimé sans fin jusques au bout
  Et encore maintenant toujours
  Pour quand je m’en irai dormir comme il faut je rêve tous les rêves
  J’envisage toutes les figures qu’elles rient rondes ou carrées ou pleuvent

  ~

  Je me défends parce que je ne suis pas dure
  Je me défends pour toi moi nous vous ils
  Tout ce qui tire sur ma corde sensible pour me secouer
  J’ai fait la liste des choses à oublier nous ne manquerons de rien
  Les cloches pourront sonner au cou de la vie vache nous aurons le vin fou nous aurons le temps gai
transpoem: |-
  When I go I’d like to have had my turn at my life
  Loved to have loved freely passionately and not at all to have loved endlessly to the end
  And still holding forever
  Since when I leave to go to bed as I should I dream all the dreams
  I picture all the faces they’re laughing round square or raining

  ~

  I fight back because I am not tough
  I fight back for you me us you they
  Everything that pushes pulls on my heartstrings to undo me
  I’ve made a list of things to forget we’ll want for nothing
  The bells can ring on this dog’s life we’ll have our fool’s wine we’ll have a good time
note: |-
  <p>I have chosen particularly short excerpts here; these five-line extracts are tiny roller-coasters, especially considering Rouzeau’s tendency to forgo punctuation in order to create overlapping phrases within phrases. An interesting moment for me was in grappling with Rouzeau’s bells that could “sonner au cou de la vie vache.”  I had initially seen the bells as ringing “until the cows come home,” although that didn’t fully encompass the misery of <em>la vie vache</em>, which then became “a dog’s life.”</p>
  <p><em>Va où</em> is a sprawling collection, and I am slowly translating and retranslating my way through it. I find that the poems hit me at a different angle every time and I find myself grasping them at different ends, which accounts for my sense of the <em>maintenant</em> in “encore maintenant toujours” as being closer – for me – to “holding” than “now.”</p>
abio: "<p>Valérie Rouzeau (1967–) is a French poet and translator. In 2012 she won
  the Prix Apollinaire for her collection <em>Vrouz</em>. Rouzeau’s poetry is adventurous
  and passionate; she works with neologisms, puns, and incorporates baby-talk in a
  fascinating blend of the adult poet’s and the little girl’s voices. Her language
  comes alive in a powerful stretch that engulfs the reader in the emotion conveyed.</p>"
tbio: "<p>Malika Kadyrova graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2015 with
  a major in comparative literature and minors in French and classical studies. She’s
  currently at Moscow State Institute of International Relations, wandering along
  the postgrad brick road in the direction of a career in simultaneous interpretation.</p>"
